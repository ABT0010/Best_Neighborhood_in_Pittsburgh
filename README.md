We are using datas obtained from WPRDC to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
# Datas used
- For Number of POGOH stations → https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/station-locations

## According to the Burgh Explorers, "The best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are those that offer both convenient mobility (bike stations & docks) and strong educational resources (number of public schools)." 
### This repository is aimed to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh in terms of neighborhood’s overall accessibility, infrastructure quality, and support for daily life.
