# Number of Affordable Housing Distributed

I wanted to determine the scale of numbers that would show how affordable housing is in Pittsburgh neighborhoods. 
The metric system that I created was based on the amount of loans that residents received between the years of 2022-2024 for home improvement and renovation in each neighborhood. 
Using the the dataset of information from the 'WPRDC' website called "ACED Allegheny Home Improvement Loan Program 2022-2024," I averaged how many each neighborhood got over the 
years and listed all neighborhoods involved. 
I chose affordable housing to determine the amount of infrastructure that Pittsburgh distributes to its 
residents to see if they prioritize Pittburgh's homelessness levels and care for residents. 
This would represent Pittsburgh's local government's efficiency along with their ability to create a stronger, inclusive financially improved community.

For this reason, we used a data table from WPRDC's "https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/aced-allegheny-home-improvement-loan-program-ahilp" a data 
that was made on September 2022 containing a list of neighborhoods in and surrounding Pittsburgh.
